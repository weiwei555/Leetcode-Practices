346 Moving Average from Data Stream:
	Sliding Window, Double ended-queue (Deque)
	
1710. Maximum Units on a Truck:
	Greedy, overriding Arrays.sort(arr, (a,b) -> Integer.compare(b[?], a[?]));
	If increasing order, Arrays.sort(arr, (a,b) -> Integer.compare(a[?], b[?]));
	
26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
	3 Pointers
	
2. Add Two Numbers  **
	LinkedList
	
1207. Unique Number of Occurrences
	HashSet, HashMap

136. Single Number
	Bitwise operation: XOR(^) for finding uniqness, XORing same element = 0
	
349. Intersection of Two Arrays
	HashSet.contains(), ArrayList
	
1260. Shift 2D Grid
	ArrayList, Arrays.asList(), matrix

118. Pascal's Triangle
	Dynamic Programming, ArrayList

169. Majority Element
	Boyer Moore Algorithm

977. Squares of a Sorted Array
	2 Pointers
	
1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
	character arithmetic('b' - 'a' = 1), frequency array instead of hashmap

217. Contains Duplicate
	HashSet, HashSet.add() returns false if duplicate
	
283. Move Zeroes ***
	2 Pointers 
	
1929. Concatenation of Array
	System.arraycopy(src, srcpos, dest, destpos, len);
	
953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary
	lexicographically = alphabetically, str.indexOf() faster than hashmap

246. Strobogrammatic Number
	StringBuilder is faster than String, new StringBuilder(), .append(), .toString()
	
2023. Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target
	HashMap.getOrDefault(key, value), Two Sums-like but substring

362. Design Hit Counter
	Queue initialized using LinkedList, sliding window

986. Interval List Intersections
	ArrayList.toArray(), two dimensional array, discard the interval with smallest endpoint each time
	
230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST *****
	DFS, recursion, BFS tree for searching nodes.left recursively for finding small value and nodes.right for large
	
529. Minesweeper ***
	DFS, recursive finding in all 8 directions on a grid

1861. Rotating the Box **
	Tail to front traversal, similar to Move Zeros

427. Construct Quad Tree
	Recursion, nearly the same with 529. Minesweeper.

399. Evaluate Division  ****************
	Didn't make it through :D Union Find (Disjoint set), too hard but should look back
	Since they ask you this :D

1740. Find Distance in a Binary Tree  **
	LCA(lowest common ancestor in tree), DFS. Find the LCA and then use that as root for DFS searching

366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree   ***
	DFS
	
1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings
	frequency array (with character minus), palindrome string (1 odd occurance char occupy 1)
	
384. Shuffle an Array
	Only need to pick later/previous index for switching to get equal possibility for every element to every position
	
729. My Calendar I  ***
	BST tree (search from middle)!

1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One
	Binary Search

361. Bomb Enemy
	Dynamic programming
	
1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
	So hard to understand... Sliding Window, Deque
	
2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips  **
	Binary Search
	
855. Exam Room ****
	TreeSet(need more practice!)
	
759. Employee Free Time
	Sorting using TreeSet(modify comparator using (a,b) -> ...), Intervals

692. Top K Frequent Words
	Sorting using PriorityQueue(modify comparator to sort object), make a class yourself, 
	using hashmap to process all words first then construct object, add to pq to sort frequency collected.

1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array **
	HashMap, reversing an int, count Pairs(CSE312)
